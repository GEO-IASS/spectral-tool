UserSetSelector (This enumeration selects the configuration set to load, save or configure. Possible values for the User Set Selector are: Default: Selects a configuration set that contains factory settings. User Set 1: Selects the first user set. When the Default configuration set is selected and loaded using User Set Load, the device must be in default factory settings state and must make sure the mandatory continuous acquisition use case works directly. Default User Set is read-only and cannot be modified.):	Default
UserSetLoad (This command loads the selected configuration set from the non-volatile memory in the camera to the volatile memory and makes the selected set the active configuration set. Once the selected set is loaded, the parameters in the selected set will control the camera.):	<NOT READABLE>
UserSetSave (This command copies the parameters in the current active configuration set into the selected user set in the camera's non-volatile memory.):	<NOT READABLE>
